jaycue is my little side project that mimics the best parts jq https://stedolan.github.io/jq/

I am TDD'ing this to get some practice, using the `jq` documentation, and hopefully make something useful. Please see below for some similar, more mature, great projects.


## Install

```console
$ npm install jaycue
```

## Usage

```js
const jq = require('jaycue');

console.log({foo: 123}, '.foo');
```

## Development
Must have `jq` installed to run tests


## Notes
I really need some kind of parser for the query, the current regex works, but it's not going to scale.
